### about : 
the first mission in the SmartMethod company, this mission is  for summer training, in this first mission we will try to create a web page to control the robot and show the result on a new page, and also save the direction in a database ... 

### first page :
On the first page, the company ask to  try to put 5 buttons to control the direction of the robot, the five button is: forward, backward, left, right, stop ...
and let these 5 buttons look like a remote.

I try to give it a look as the company asks.

and this is how it looks :

### action & second page:
what action will happen when the user clicks on one button?  , it will open a new page have the same direction the user clicks in, and save this direction in the database...

but if you want it to work you must use XAMPP, let Apache and, MySQL start working, and write a localhost in the URL.

## Database : 
my database has two attributes, ID " Which is a primary, and It fills automatically ", and the direction loaded from the web page we create.

this is what my database looks like :

## update :
I added another button called "LastD" When you press it, it  prints the last direction in the database.. and the buttons be like this:
